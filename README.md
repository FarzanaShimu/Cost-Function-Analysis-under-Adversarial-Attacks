# Cost-Function-Analysis-under-Adversarial-Attacks
Goal: Investigate how adversarial inputs affect the cost function and predictions of logistic regression. Details: Implement adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM) to create perturbed input data. Measure the impact on cost function values and model predictions. Propose mitigation strategies using robust optimization or regularization.
